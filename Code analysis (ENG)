Analysis of the Calendar Display Program Using Python's calendar Module
This Python program allows users to display a specific month's calendar for a given year. It utilizes the built-in calendar module to format and print the calendar in a user-friendly manner. Below is a detailed analysis of the program’s functionality and its components:

Functionality Overview:
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter a year and a month (from 1 to 12). This input is crucial for generating the correct calendar.
Calendar Object Initialization:

The calendar.TextCalendar class is instantiated with calendar.SUNDAY as the first day of the week. This means that the calendar will start each week on Sunday. This customization can be changed based on user preferences.
Generating the Month Calendar:

The formatmonth(year, month) method is called on the TextCalendar object. This method generates a string representing the month’s calendar in a text format that includes the day names and aligns the days properly.
Displaying the Calendar:

The generated calendar string (month_calendar) is printed to the console, providing the user with a clear visual representation of the selected month and year.
Code Breakdown:
Importing the Calendar Module:

The line import calendar imports the necessary library to work with calendar functionalities. The calendar module provides various functions to handle operations related to calendars.
Defining the Function display_calendar:

The function display_calendar() encapsulates the logic for input, processing, and output. This function can be called whenever the user wants to display a calendar.
Input Handling:

The program uses input() to gather the year and month from the user. It converts these inputs into integers to be used as arguments for the calendar functions.
Calendar Generation:

The cal.formatmonth(year, month) method formats the calendar for the specified month and year, producing a multi-line string that visually represents the calendar.
Printing the Result:

Finally, the formatted calendar is printed to the console, allowing the user to see the layout of days for the specified month.
Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The program allows users to easily input the desired year and month, making it straightforward to retrieve the desired calendar.

Customizable Start Day: Users can modify the first day of the week by changing the parameter in the TextCalendar instantiation.

Clear Output Format: The output is neatly formatted, making it easy to read and understand.

Possible Enhancements:
Input Validation: The program can be enhanced by adding input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numeric values for the year and month, handling potential errors gracefully.

Extended Features: Additional features can be included, such as displaying multiple months, adding holidays, or integrating with a GUI for better interactivity.

Export Functionality: The program could be modified to export the displayed calendar to a file (e.g., PDF or image) for easy sharing and printing.

Use Cases:
Personal Planning: Users can utilize this program to check their schedules or plan activities based on the monthly calendar layout.

Educational Tool: This program serves as a simple educational resource for learning about calendars and dates in Python.

Event Scheduling: The calendar display can assist in organizing events, meetings, or any other activities that require date reference.

Overall, this program is a useful utility for displaying calendars using Python’s built-in capabilities, and it can be further developed into a more comprehensive calendar application with additional features.
